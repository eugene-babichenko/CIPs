# Abstract

This specification describes the binary structure of addresses in Cardano, covering both addresses introduced in the Shelley era and the legacy format from the Byron era.

# Motivation

Document design choices for posterity. Most applications interacting with the Cardano blockchain will likely not have any need for this level of details, however some might. This CIP is meant to capture this knowledge. 

# Specification

## Overview

In Cardano, addresses are comprised of two parts, a **header** and a **payload**. Depending on the header, the interpretation of the payload varies. 

In the header, bits [7;4] indicates the type of addresses being used; we'll call these four bits the **header type**. The remaining four bits [3;0] are either unused or refer to what we'll call the **network tag**. There are currently 11 types of addresses in Cardano which we'll divide in three categories: [Shelley addresses], [stake addresses] and [Byron addresses]. 

```
  1 byte     variable length   
 <------> <-------------------> 
┌────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ header │        payload      │
└────────┴─────────────────────┘
    🔎                          
    ╎          7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  
    ╎         ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐ 
    ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌ │t│t│t│t│n│n│n│n│ 
              └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘ 
```

See also the more detailed [ABNF grammar in annex](CIP-0016-cardano-addresses.abnf).

#### Network Tag

Except for [Byron addresses] (type 8 = `1000`), the second half of the header (bits [3;0]) refers the network tag which can have the following values and semantics. Other values of the network tag are currently reserved for future network types. In the case of [Byron addresses], bits [3;0] have a completely separate definition detailed in the section below.

Network Tag (`. . . . n n n n`)   | Semantic
---                               | ---
`....0000`                        | Testnet(s) 
`....0001`                        | Mainnet

#### User-facing Encoding 

By convention, Shelley and stake addresses are encoded using [bech32] with human-readable prefixes defined in [CIP-0005]. Byron addresses are however encoded in [base58]. Historically, Byron addresses were introduced before the design of bech32, which solves various issues of the base58 encoding format (see [bech32's motivation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#motivation) for more detail). Byron addresses were however kept as Base58 to easily distinguish them from new addresses introduced in Shelley, massively making use of bech32 for encoding small binary objects.

Summarizing:

| Address Type | Encoding | Example                                                                                                              |
| ---          | ---      | ---                                                                                                                  |
| Byron        | Base58   | `37btjrVyb4KDXBNC4haBVPCrro8AQPHwvCMp3RFhhSVWwfFmZ6wwzSK6JK1hY6wHNmtrpTf1kdbva8TCneM2YsiXT7mrzT21EacHnPpz5YyUdj64na` |
| Shelley      | bech32   | `addr1vpu5vlrf4xkxv2qpwngf6cjhtw542ayty80v8dyr49rf5eg0yu80w`                                                         |
| stake        | bech32   | `stake1vpu5vlrf4xkxv2qpwngf6cjhtw542ayty80v8dyr49rf5egfu2p0u`                                                        |


## Shelley Addresses 

There are currently 8 types of Shelley addresses summarized in the table below:

Header type (`t t t t . . . .`) | Payment Part     | Delegation Part
---                             | ---              | ---
(0) `0000....`                  | `PaymentKeyHash` | `StakeKeyHash`
(1) `0001....`                  | `ScriptHash`     | `StakeKeyHash`
(2) `0010....`                  | `PaymentKeyHash` | `ScriptHash`
(3) `0011....`                  | `ScriptHash`     | `ScriptHash`
(4) `0100....`                  | `PaymentKeyHash` | `Pointer`
(5) `0101....`                  | `ScriptHash`     | `Pointer`
(6) `0110....`                  | `PaymentKeyHash` | ø
(7) `0111....`                  | `ScriptHash`     | ø

- `PubKeyHash` and `StakeKeyHash` refers to `blake2b-224` hash digests of Ed25519 verification keys. How keys are obtained is out of the scope of this specification. Interested readers may look at [CIP-1852] for more details.

- `ScriptHash` refers to `blake2b-224` hash digests of serialized monetary scripts. How scripts are constructed and serialized is out of the scope of this specification.

- `Pointer` is detailed in a section below.

#### Payment part

Fundamentally, the first part of a Shelley address indicates the ownership of the funds associated with the address. We call it, the **payment part**. Whoever owns the payment parts owns any funds at the address. As a matter of fact, in order to spend from an address, one must provide a witness attesting that the address can be spent. In the case of a `PubKeyHash`, it means providing a signature of the transaction body made with the signing key corresponding to the hashed public key (as well as the public key itself for verification). For monetary scripts, it means being able to provide the source script, and meet the necessary conditions to validate the script. 

#### Delegation part

The second part of a Shelley address indicates the ownership of the stake rights associated with the address. We call it, the **delegation part**. Whoever owns the delegation parts owns the stake rights of any funds associated with the address. In most scenarios, the payment part and the delegation part are owned by the same party. Yet it is possible to construct addresses where both parts are owned and managed by separate entities. We call such addresses **mangled addresses** or **hybrid addresses**. 

Some addresses (types 6 and 7) carry no delegation part whatsoever. Their associated stake can't be delegated. They can be use by parties who want to prove that they are not delegating funds which is typically the case for custodial businesses managing funds on the behalf of other stakeholders. Delegation parts can also be defined in terms of on-chain [pointers]. 

#### Pointers

In an address, a pointers refers to a point of the chain containing a stake key registration certificate. A point is identified by a 3 coordinates:

- An absolute slot number 
- A transaction index (within that slot)
- An output index (within that transaction)

These coordinates form a concise way of referring to a stake key (typically half the size of a stake key hash). They are serialized as three variable-length positive numbers following the ABNF grammar here below:

```abnf
POINTER = VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; slot number
        | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; transaction index
        | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT ; output index

VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT = (%b1 | UINT7 | VARIABLE-LENGTH-UINT) 
                     / (%b0 | UINT7)

UINT7 = 7BIT 
```

## Stake Addresses

TODO

## Byron Addresses

Before diving, please acknowledge that a lot of the supported capabilities of Byron addresses have remained mainly unused. The initial design showed important trade-offs and rendered unpractical to sustain the long-term goals of the network. A new format was created when introducing Shelley and Byron addresses were kept only for backward compatibility. 


Like many other objects on the Cardano blockchain yet unlike Shelley addresses, Byron addresses are [CBOR]-encoded binary objects. Conveniently enough, the first 4 bits of their first byte are always equal to `1000....` which allows to land back on our feet w.r.t to the address type. Their internal structure is however vastly different and a bit unusual. 

```
┌────────┬──────────────┬────────┐

└────────┴──────────────┴────────┘

                                 ╎        
                                 ╰╌╌ Verification Key
                                 ╰╌╌ Redemption Key
```

The address `root` uniquely identifies the address, and is a double-hash digest (SHA3-256, and then Blake2b-224) of the address type, spending data and attributes. 

Then comes the address attributes which are both optional. The network tag is present only on test networks and contains an identifier which is used for network discrimination. The [derivation path] (detailed below) was used by legacy so-called random wallets in the early days of Cardano and its usage was abandoned with the introduction of Yoroi and so-called _Icarus_ addresses. 

Finally, the address type allows for distinguishing different sub-types of Byron addresses. `Redeem` addresses are used inside the Byron genesis configuration and were given to early investors who helped funding the project. 

A full and more detailed [CDDL specification of Byron addresses](CIP-0016-byron-addresses.cddl) is given in annex to the CIP. 

#### Derivation path 

Historically, Cardano wallets have been storing information about the wallet structure directly within the address. This information comes in the form of two derivation indexes (in the sense of child key derivation as defined in [BIP-0032]) which we call **derivation path**. To protect wallet's anonymity, the derivation path is stored encrypted using a ChaCha20/Poly1305 authenticated cipher.
